      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! I’m a passionate student at the intersection of <strong>marketing</strong> and <strong>computer science</strong>, with a strong interest in digital marketing and web design. I enjoy solving problems that sit between creative communication and technical implementation, and have been able to practice this skill throughout my time at university and the jobs I've had. Apart from my career interest and academic specializations, I am also someone that enjoys listening to music, creating boards on Pinterest, running my Depop business, spending time outside, cooking, and traveling to new places with friends. I am always open to opportunities that will grant me new experiences- whether that be paragliding in Colombia, hiking the caldera in Santorini, or simply signing up for a class on a subject that is totally unfamiliar to me, which is how I found my niche in college. I enjoy being challenged in all aspects of my life, and despite these challenges often being difficult and time-consuming, their transformative nature is unparallel.</p>

      <p>I've lived in several different places throughout my life, from Houston to Boise to now currently in Bellingham. Upon graduation new year, I am planning to move to Seattle to start a new chapter and begin my professional career. I am interested in eventually working for a digital marketing agency or in some other tech-related marketing field, but I'm always open to whatever direction the world decides to take me. I've always been a hardworking, dedicated lifelong learner, and I never want to stop my pursuit of knowledge or new skills. Learning keeps your mind fresh and your soul content- or at least that's what I believe. One of my favorite ways to learn is through travel, especially relating to learning about new cultures and how they perceive the world. As an American, I find it very rewarding to experience other cultures to gain a better understanding of the world I live in.</p>
