    <h1>Unplugging for a Day</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>The Plan</h3>
    <p>I decided that I would try to pick a day where I was already busy for my "unplugged" day. Therefore, I chose Saturday to be the day I did not open my computer, spend hours scrolling on my phone, or send non-urgent messages. Going into this day, I set some guidelines for myself and as determined my definition of being "unplugged" for the day. I would not check my computer, play on my switch, or open social media. I would also refrain from calling or texting unless there was a need for it, basically just making sure that if I was calling or texting it was out of necessity. I decided it was fine to still listen to music, because music has existed for most of humanity and I could listen without being on my phone actively. Another exception I allowed myself was minimal TV, because that has also been around before the internet. Other than that, the plan was to keep myself from interacting with my phone as much as possible throughout the day.</p>

    <h3>My Day</h3>
    <p>I woke up on my own since it was Saturday and I didn't need to set an alarm, but had to refrain from immediately grabbing my phone to check on things. I decided to get up slowly, brush my teeth, get ready for the day, and then when eating breakfast I quickly skimmed my messages to make sure there was nothing urgent, which there wasn't, so I turned my phone back off. I spent my morning chatting with roommates, then going to the gym, where I did listen to music but did nothing else on my phone besides check the time. After the gym I went grocery shopping and then laid out in the sun on my deck for a few hours, listening to music, talking with roommates, and reading. Honestly my day flew by very quickly because of how busy I was, and I didn't miss my phone too much. I got ready and went out to dinner with my boyfriend, and then we went home and watched True Detective. Before going to sleep I really wanted to scroll Instagram, but I remained strong and just fell asleep.</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Because I was very busy that day, and because I did not have work or school to need internet for, I honestly really enjoyed doing things besides just endlessly scrolling or doing homework. I did also realize how dependent I am on my phone for things, even little things that I would not consider "using the internet" for. For example, I needed my phone on Saturday to check the time, play music, put in directions, and have just in case someone texted me or called me with a pressing issue. I think I would really enjoy living in a time where I wasn't so reliant on my phone, but in this day and age that is not possible for me unless I decided to become a nun or move off the grid. Which doesn't sound too bad either. Overall, I learned that I tend to waste time scrolling on my phone when it could be better used to complete tasks, delve into hobbies, or just relax.</p>
